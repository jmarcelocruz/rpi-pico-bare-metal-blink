# rpi-pico-bare-metal-blink

This was supposed to be a simple project... Go from zero to a blinking LED, without using the Pico SDK. In the end, it ended amassing quite a bit more code than I anticipated as I followed a couple of online courses on bare metal programming.

This is what I learned with this project:

- linker scripts
- startup code
- interacting and configuring clocks & peripherals
- most importantly, navigating a datasheet and writing code from it

While I acknowledge there is room for improvement (especially in the app code, the delay and button press/depress detection could be handled better), I believe my time can be better spent leveling up other skills.

If this project is interesting to you, feel free to build from it :)
